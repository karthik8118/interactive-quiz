# AI in and for Society

## Statements

### Session 1

#### Understandding the social world

* Understanding the [social world](#social-sciences) means doing your best [empirically](#empirical) and [conceptually](#conceptual) to produce a faithful account of [subjective](#subjectiv) experiences in relation to their [objective](#objectiv) conditions of possibility. Taking responsibility for these accounts always entails exploring alternative accounts and their consequences.

### Session 2

#### Experiential Accounts

* Accounts of individual experiences are never simply 'authentic' but always shaped by situational (people are sharing something with you for a reason) and dispositional (social conditions) available narrative saspects

### Session 4

#### Structure-Agency Spectrum

* The perspectives towards the individual/agency end of the structure-agency spectrum are better suited to interpret specific social situation. The structural perspectives are better suited to understand what kind of social order arises from social situations

### Session 6

#### Artefacts, Politics, and Society

##### Artefacts have politics

* Infrastructures and technologies are never politically and ethically neutral. They embody assumptions and imaginaries about society through:
  * Purposeful choice
  * Standards
  * [Discourses](#discourse) ([Foucault](#michel-foucault))
  * Economics and R&D funding
  * Politics & Ideology
* Every technical decision — from algorithms and code to hardware and institutional structures — is inscribed with ideas about social and moral order ⇒ technology is society made durable (Latour)

##### Reasemling the social

* Based on ideas from [Weber](#max-weber), [Durkheim](#émile-durkheim), and others, social facts are phenomena [sui generis](#sui-generis) and must be explained by other social facts
* Theories from [Actor-Network-Theory](#actor-network-theory), [Situated Knowledge](#situated-knowledge) and relational thinking (e.g. [Donna Haraway](#donna-haraway)) remind us that:
  * The social is constantly reassembled.
  * ([Agency](#agency)) is distributed across networks.
  * Entities as distinct as a human, a line of code, or a building are interrelated.

##### The social in Science and Technology Studies

* ‘The social’ as the making of relations between very different actors, e.g. humans, technologies and infrastructures, animals, landscapes, ideas, …
* Relational [Ontology](#ontology):
  * Instead of assuming essential cores, relational thinking asks how 'entities' are [assembled](#assembled) and [stabilized](#stabilized) through interactions
  * Example: Instead of taking a technology (e.g. ChatGPT) for granted, ask what other elements must exist and interact (form relations) for ChatGPT to exist and make sense to people
* Flat [Ontology](#ontology):
  * No single actor (human or non-human) is ranked higher — each contributes to the formation and stabilization of socio-technical phenomena (technology is not passive, think bridges, algorithms)
  * Example: you, an algorithm, a company and a law, all contribute to stabilise the phenomenon that is ChatGPT

##### People are different from rocks

* But:
  * Not all people share the Western categorical distinction between nature and culture
  * Science is neither universal nor the only legitimate way of knowing and being in the world ([continingency](#contingency))
  * ['The social'](#the-social) (aka people) is separated from nature and technology only in Western modern scientific thinking
  * Relational thinking deconstructs the categorical separation between human and technology, revealing that social order emerges from the interplay of various actors
* Key Consequence:
  * We are responsible for assembling the socio-technical worlds around us. When tweaking an algorithm, writing a line of code or developing a new idea, consider:
    * What world are you contributing to?
    * What alternative worlds might be possible?
    * How do ethical and political assumptions influence your choices?

### Session 7

#### Politics

##### Politics and subpolitics

* Politics:
  * [Weber](#max-weber): “to understand by politics only the leadership or the influencing of the leadership of a state”
  * Politics with a capital “P”:
    * analysis of those granted powers — e.g., elected officials in liberal democracies
    * matters of the state, its actors, institutions, and arenas
* Subpolitics:
  * Beck, Bovens: “Politics has been ‘dispersed’ or ‘displaced’…
  * Recognizes significant political action beyond the state
  * Dilemma: balancing democratic legitimacy with technical expertise in subpolitical decisions (e.g., nuclear reactors, AI governance)
  * Jasanoff: human and reasoned balance between power and knowledge

##### Five notions of politics in science and technology studies

1. New associations and [cosmograms](#cosmology):
    * Science and technology ⇒ new relationships between humans and non-humans ⇒ reshaping our understanding of the world
    * New technologies or truth claims emerge ⇒ integrated into the existing common world ⇒ modify the collective ⇒ new associations and [cosmograms](#cosmology)
    * **AI**: analyse how ChatGPT comes into the world as a new entity, i.e. understand development that lead to object and how object is fitted into collectives
2. [Public](#publics) and its problems:
    * Not '[ready-made publics](#ready-made-publics)' but '[issue publics](#issue-publics)'
    * Politics: Emerging [publics](#publics) and their struggle to convert an uncertain issue into a manageable problem
    * **AI**: analyse the public debates that unfold after the release of GPTs trying to understand what this will do to society
3. Sovereignty:
    * Friend-Foe distinction as basis for political thought and action
    * Political spaces = where “self” and “other” are antagonistically negotiated
    * **AI**: Analyse political strategies to position soft/hardware as 'our thing' (e.g. US-American Chip Act trying to break dominance of Taiwan in chip production)
4. Deliberative Assemblies:
    * Civil society deliberates until the best arguments win ([discourse ethics](#discourse-ethics))
    * Politics: spaces of deliberation, oftentimes classic political representatives plus forums for civil society
    * **AI**: analyse spaces of deliberation such as parliaments, citizens’ forums etc. that try to discuss latest developments and possible futures
5. Governmentality:
    * Power/knowledge is organised through [discourses](#discourse) ([Foucault](#michel-foucault))
    * Politics: all institutions (military, pedagogy) that seem apolitical but produce power/knowledge and thus reproduce social/moral order
    * **AI**: analyse the discourses that shape soft/hardware development as power/knowledge (e.g. from tech nerd to brogrammer, open source and transparency etc.)

##### Ontological politics

* = the struggle over which world comes to be and which other possible worlds are made latent or disappear
* Producing knowledge is performative, i.e. producing knowledge shapes the world in specific ways: worlding ([epistem-ontology](#epistem-ontology))
* Politics: the production of knowledge and technology as a form of making the world in certain ways
* **AI**: Organising GPTs as open source or proprietary software can be understood as knowledge-based forms of worlding
* Producing knowledge, e.g. your current and future job, is always also making worlds for which you carry responsibility ([ethico-epistem-ontology](#ethico-epistem-ontology))

### Session 8

#### Economy

##### From economy to economisation

* Established view in public and scientific [discourse](#discourse): the economy exists and is known by [economics](#economics)

* Economisation:
  * Exchange systems and how they order how people live together has been for a long time ...
  * ... at some point activities, behaviours, objects, and institutions come to be understood as 'economic' (why? how?)

##### Formalist vs Substantivist economics

* If we describe exchange systems and practices in economic terms, what is covered and what is excluded?
* Formalist position:
  * define the economy by its object, i.e. the study of utility maximisation under conditions of scarcity
  * Rational economic behaviour
  * Individuals follow universal 'formal' rules in economic behaviour
* Substantivist position:
  * Economic is everything that a society does to reproduce itself and meet its material needs
  * Embeddedness in socio-cultural contexts
  * Circulation of goods mediated by institutions rather than economic behaviour

##### Markets to marketisation

* Markets enable standardized socio-technical exchanges involving diverse goods and valuation methods.
* They reflect power struggles in price-setting, balancing fairness and conflict.
* Market encounters range from local bazaars to global supply chains, shaped by algorithms and trust.

##### Conclusion

* Markets shape society and can be [empirically](#empirical) analyzed as socio-technical arrangements similar to [subpolitics](#politics-and-subpolitics).  
* An ideal approach merges economics with analysis of [marketisation](#markets-to-marketisation) practices and the production of economic knowledge.  
* As marketisation accelerates, algorithmic tools—carrying [epistemic](#epistemology), political, and ethical implications—must be carefully designed.  
* Aim to make market processes transparentso [publics](#publics) can form.

## People

### Session 1

#### Sir Karl Popper

* [critical rationalism](#critical-rationalism)

#### Wilhelm Dilthey

* the methodologies and [epistemologies](#epistemology) of the [natural](#natural-sciences) and [social sciences](#social-sciences) differ fundamentally
* [explaining](#explaining) ([natural sciences](#natural-sciences)) vs. [understanding](#understanding) ([social sciences](#social-sciences))
* "[understanding](#understanding)" is the appropriate method for the [social sciences](#social-sciences)

#### Pierre Bourdieu

* Understanding social phenomena:
  * social conditions ([objectiv](#objectiv)) ⇔ individual experience ([subjectiv](#subjectiv)); they shape each other (Bourdieu tries to balance structural elements and individual agency)
  * avoid reducing unique cases to preset categories ([typology](#typology))
  * [situation](#situation) and [disposition](#disposition) need to come together in the analysis
  * In order to [understand](#understanding) an individual experience we need a [generic](#generic) and [genetic](#genetic) comprehension of the individual:
    * a grasp of the circumstances of life and the social mechanisms affecting the entire group (high school students, skilled workers, magistrates)
    * a grasp of the conditions (psychological & social), associated with a given [position](#disposition) and trajectory in social space
  * [understanding](#understanding) and [explaining](#explaining) are one
  * In order to understand an indivudal experience we need to minimize the distance to our counterpart but still realize that we are looking from our own perspective
* Concepts (often used in colloquial language):
  * [Habitus](#habitus)
  * [Social Capital](#social-capital)
  * [Social field](#social-field)
* Understanding society:
  * Understanding society ⇒ distinctions between people ⇒ how within [social fields](#social-field), [habituated](#habitus) individuals struggle for position using [capitalia](#social-capital) as currency

### Session 2

#### Donna Haraway

* “I think my problem, and *our* problem, is how to have **simultaneously**:
  * an account of **radical historical [contingency](#contingency)** for **all knowledge** claims and **[knowing subjects](#knowing-subjects)**,
  * a critical practice for recognizing our own **[semiotic technologies](#semiotic-technologies)** for making meanings,
  * and a no-nonsense commitment to **[faithful accounts](#faithful-accounts) of a "real" world**

### Session 3

#### Erving Goffman

* social situations are scripted
  * not [deterministic](#determinism)
  * multiple scripts
  * script execution is not a matter of rational choice
  * not in people’s heads
* Scripts:
  * a script directs a social situation
  * it is reproduced through this process
  * scripts are social phenomena
  * they cannot be changed at the individual level, though individuals contribute to their execution, reproduction, and development

#### Émile Durkheim

* Understanding 'the social':
  * 'the social' as a level of analysis [sui generis](#sui-generis) (it is analysed directly and not via its constituent parts)
  * you can explain 'the social' (social facts) only from 'the social' (social facts)
  * understanding society ⇒ understanding social order ⇒ understanding social facts ⇒ understanding earlier social facts
* Social facts (Norms):
  * norms exist in society that constrain peoples behaviour
  * norms evolve at least in part independently of their enactments in specific social situations

#### Marilyn Strathern

* Fractal:
  * almost everything about a society is present in any simple social situation even when almost nothing happens
  * to understand the smallest of interactions, you really need to understand the whole of society
  * at whatever scale you cho0se to investigate a social phenomenon, it arguably remains equally complex

#### Karl Marx

* Historical materialism:
  * the social world is shaped by the material conditions of life
  * it is not the [consciousness](#consciousness) of men that determines their being, but, on the contrary, their social being that determines their [consciousness](#consciousness)
  * in a capitalist society, the [commodification](#commodification) of labour leads to a profound [alienation](#alienation) of workers from both their creative and social selves, while simultaneously, a system of [ideologies](#ideologies) (false consciousness) obscures the reality of this exploitation
* Understanding society:
  * understanding society ⇒ understanding class struggle as the [dialectial](#dialectical) driver of societal r/evolution towards communism
  * analysing asymmetrical distribution of means and [relations](#relations) of production
* interested in the drivers and dynamics of social change and how to trigger it

  * Underlying universal mental structures shape different forms of cultural expression
    * Language systems
    * Kinship systems
    * Myths
    * Cultural Practices
  * Binary oppositions: live/death; nature/culture; raw/cooked; rich/poor; winner/loser
* Understanding society:
  * understanding society ⇒ understanding the deep mental structures behind
the visible cultural patterns of everyday life
  * [comparative analysis](#comparative-analysis) of e.g. myths, i.e. stories that allow us to infer deep mental structures

### Session 4

#### Max Weber

* Cultural beings:
  * Human beings are 'cultural beings' ⇒ they act not of necessity (nature) but out of their own free will and in ways that create meaning
  * 'cultural beings' = struggling individuals trying to make sense of the world around them and square individual freedom against social order
* [Social action](#social-action):
  * People make sense of the world around them by attaching subjective meaning to the world and their actions within it
* Understanding society:
  * understanding the social ⇒ attending to individual experience and sense-making
  * Understanding society ⇒ interpreting individual experience ⇒ moving to [ideal types](#ideal-types)
* concerned with how the world becomes disenchanted, because the modern rationality, capitalist industrialisation, and the iron cage of bureaucracy disconnect people from a deeper sense of meaining

#### Stuart Hall

* identity politics vs. politics of identity:
  * [identity](#identity) politics:
    * the collective mobilization of social groups (e.g., based on race, gender, sexuality, or religion) to advocate for rights, recognition, and power, often in response to historical marginalization
    * emphasizes group-based solidarity and political struggle
  * politics of [identity](#identity):
    * examines how identities are socially constructed, contested, and performed within cultural and political contexts
    * focuses on how identity is shaped by discourse, power, and social structures
  * Individuals have [identities](#identity) (at least in the West)
* [Cultural](#culture) Studies vs. [Marxism](#karl-marx):
  * [Marx](#karl-marx):
    * Base: [relations of production](#relations-of-production)
    * Superstructure: echos of base
  * Cultural Studies:
    * Base: [relations of production](#relations-of-production)
    * Superstructure: struggle for [cultural hegemony](#cultural-hegemony)
* Understanding society:
  * understanding society ⇒ understanding the struggle for [cultural hegemony](#cultural-hegemony)

### Session 5

#### Michel Foucault

* [Poststructuralism](#postsructuralism):
  * Political power and knowledge:
    * are intricately linked within discourses
    * structure what counts as right within a society in any given epoch
  * [Strucuralism](#structuralism) vs. [Poststructuralism](#postsructuralism):
    * [Structuralism](#structuralism): Fixed structures
    * [Poststructuralism](#postsructuralism): Structures evolve over time
  * Example: Imagine a woman in Germany standing in the central square of a city screaming. What do most people think?
    * 16th century: witch (men need to control her – church – burn her)
    * 19th century: hysterical (men need to control her – psychiatry – lock her up)
    * early 20th century: she has lost it (men need to control her – husband – house arrest)
    * Late 20th century: it’s an identity thing (men need to work around her – exclusion)
    * 21st century: she has a good reason (men don’t come into it)
* [Discourse](#discourse):
  * emerges from everything that is being said and done ⇒ totality forms the conditions for knowledge and meaning production (in a given society in a given epoch on a certain topic)
  * shape what counts as true and right in any given society in any given epoch
  * construct the phenomena of which they speak (instead of representing phenomena that are 'out there')
* [Discourse](#discourse) analysis:
  * Interested in the social and [epistemic](#epistemology) conditions that make something count as true in [society](#society)
  * Not interested in whether an individual considers something true or meaningful ([Weber](#max-weber)) (anti-humanist in the sense that [discourses](#discourse) are relations of [propositions](#proposition) and not networks of people)
  * Analysing '[structures](#structuralism)' but these structures are not timeless and [deterministic](#determinism) but emerge within social practice and evolve over time ⇒ shifts in discourse
* Governmentality and Biopower:
  * contrasts with [sovereign power](#sovereign-power) (“take life and let live”) by focusing on managing and shaping life (“make live and let die”)
  * emerged from the 16th century onward, shifting from [repressive](#repressive-power) to [productive power](#productive-power)
  * [disciplinary power](#disciplinary-power) (16th/17th centuries) and [regulatory power](#regulatory-power) (18th/19th centuries)
* Power/Knowledge:
  * creates norms, classifies deviance, and shapes what counts as truth
  * how to analyse:
    * Do not look for political power in a centre, but through the networks
    * Do not look for conscious intent, but for effective practices
    * Power as [relational](#relational-power), the individual is the effect of power and the site of its articulation
    * Power operates 'bottom-up' through mechanisms rather than global rule
    * Not ideology matters, but the effective instruments through which power/knowledge is produced and stored
  * ⇒ shaping discouse is power
* Discourses form subjects:
  * Discourses "[interpellate](#interpellate)" people ⇒ discourse makes subjects
  * People either:
    * conform with dominant discourses (the consumer, the diligent worker, the caring mother)
    * resist dominant discourses (gay pride (resists heteronormativity), [4B Movement](#4b-movement) (resist patriarchal violence))
  * Outside politics = trying to find a way to be a person or live a life outside of these dominant discourses, is very difficult

#### Ian Hacking

* Study the [matrix](#matrix) within a society at any given time that shapes the engines of discovery that produce knowledge and classifications that impact the ways to be a person (autism, ADHD, obesity, refugee status, …)
* Looping effects:
  * Ways to be a person ⇒ Knowledge production ⇒ Classification & Interventions ⇒ Ways to be a person ⇒ ...
    * Knowledge Production (Engines of Discovery):
      * Count, Quantify, Create Norms, Correlate, Medicalise, Biologise, Geneticise
    * Classification & Interventions:
      * Normalise, Bureaucratise
    * Ways to be a person:
      * Reclaim your identity (effects how people understand themselves)
  * Example ADHD
  * How to analyse the [matrix](#matrix):
    * Classifications, People, Institutions, Knowledge(s), Experts

#### Eduardo Viveiros de Castro

* [Cosmology](#cosmology):
  * Naturalism:
    * Based on the idea of a single nature underlying all beings
    * Assumes a continuity between humans and animals through evolution
    * Distinguishes humans through the interplay of biology and culture
  * Perspectivism:
    * Assumes a metaphysical continuity between all beings, as they all take a perspective
    * Suggests that differences arise from varying viewpoints rather than fixed essences
    * Everything capable of [deixis](#deixis) is considered "human"
  * What we learn:
    * Other peoples distinguish differently between nature and culture
    * It is extremely difficult to really understand ([Bourdieu](#pierre-bourdieu)) someone else’s way of being in the world or being a person ([epistemology](#epistemology)/[ontology](#ontology))
    * Epistemicides: the destruction of other ways of knowing:
      * Kidnapping and enslavement of Africans
      * Women burned as witches in Europe
